##HTML5 Multitouch Presentation
###presented at Standards Next in Oslo, May 2012

This is the full sourcecode for the presentation I held on multitouch in HTML5 at the Opera hosted [StandardsNext](http://standards-next.org/) event in Oslo on May 26th 2012. The entire presentation, and all the demos, can be found at [my website](http://projects.mariusgundersen.net/multitouch). 

All of the content here is designed to run on a mobile device, and will therefore not run very well in a desktop browser. The presentation was designed with the Blackbery PlayBook in mind, so most examples will run on a Webkit browser, but might not run as well in other browsers. This presentation focused on getting multitouch to work cross platform and browser, and to show some of the challenges I have demos that won't work very well or at all on certain platforms. 

To navigate through the presentation, click (or touch) the right and left side of the screen (to go forwards and backwards, respectively). Some slides are linked to a demo, which can be reached by clicking in the center of the screen.
